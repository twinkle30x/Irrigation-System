# Irrigation-System

This is a project made with Arduino.

Depending on the humidity of the soil, the temperature of the environment and the light intensity of the sun, 
the system starts zone 1 for a set period of time, then stops for a programmable pause, then starts zone 2 for another period of time. 

A short video with the LCD showing the values read from the sensors and decide which zone is ON or OFF:

I also added some photos with the diagram, hardware diagram and how the system looked inside and outside.
